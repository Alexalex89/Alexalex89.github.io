My name is Alexander Alexandrowitz, and I was born in Aachen in 1989. As a Cloud Engineer with a background in software development, I have a profound passion for automation, Python programming, and smart home technologies. I am experienced in working with Kubernetes, holding both CKAD and CKA certifications.
Beyond my technical pursuits, I am also interested in music, which inspires me.
